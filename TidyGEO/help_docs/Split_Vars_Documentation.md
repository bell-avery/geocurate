## Splitting key-value pairs

If one or more columns contain key-value pairs separated by a delimiter, like

`donor: Donor 1`

...then these columns might need to be split so the value is by itself. These values will be split on a delimiter, which is one or more characters between the key and the value. In the above example, the delimiter would be ":&nbsp;".
