##Matching Up Datasets

If one dataset for a series (clinical, feature, or assay) contains samples that another dataset does not contain, you may only want to include the samples that are in both datasets. To do this, select the datasets you would like to match from the drop-down lists, followed by the columns in each dataset you are comparing.

You can view a preview of what will be matched up on the **Workbench** tab. Once you click **Match**, any dataset that previously had extra samples will have those samples removed.

**Click on the animation below to see an example of matching up datasets with GSE41.**
