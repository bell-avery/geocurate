## Transposing the data

Transposing the data switches the rows and the columns, so the ID column becomes the column names and the column names become the ID column. This could be helpful in many ways, for example, if one wanted to make wide data (too many columns) taller.

If there are not all unique values in the ID column, transpose will not work because the new column names need to be unique. So, if you use a different column ID and "keep all" as a summarize option, transpose will be disabled.
