---------------------

#### Summary
TidyGEO is an application that allows scientists to quickly download and reformat data from the online repository Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

#### Motivation
GEO datasets are often formatted in a way that is difficult to combine with other datasets and difficult to analyze using computational tools. TidyGEO enables users to access the raw data from GEO and format it for their own research purposes. 

#### Utility
As users transform the data in various ways, TidyGEO keeps track of the changes and writes an R script that allows the users to document the changes. 

#### Goal
TidyGEO hopes to speed up the process of curating GEO datasets for research and enable scientists who do not have coding experience to access and manipulate the raw data.

#### Looking to try out the app?
TidyGEO is currently hosted here: https://tidygeo.shinyapps.io/tidygeo/

To get started, look at the help documentation within the app, then load any series into the app. Series with fewer than 100 samples generally load faster. One good series to start with is GSE41.
