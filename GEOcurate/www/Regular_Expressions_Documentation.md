## Using Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are search terms that are useful for matching multiple similar words or phrases. For example, to search for words starting with "t", one might use the regular expression `^[Tt]`, where `^` indicates that "t" is at the start of a line, and `[Tt]` indicates that we are looking for both capital and lowercase "t".

If you do not know how to use regex, it is best to leave the regex option unchecked. This is especially true if you are trying to search literal characters such as ".", "$", or "[".
