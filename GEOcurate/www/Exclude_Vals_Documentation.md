## Excluding values from a column

You may want to remove some of the values in a column, for example, if you have missing (`NA`) values. Excluding a value will take out the entire row that contains that value in the selected column.

You may choose to either remove particular values from the data, or to remove a range of numeric values from the data.

After choosing which values to exclude, you can click "Exclude" to remove the rows containing these values.

If there is a mistake with how "Exclude" was evaluated, you can click "Undo" to restore the data to its previous state. Please note that "Undo" only goes back one evaluation.

Please note that when excluding a range of values, the specified range includes both the lower and upper limits.

Here is an example of the substituting variables functionality with GSE68849:
