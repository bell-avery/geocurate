## Downloading data from Gene Expression Omnibus

This tool works with **Series** data from the online repository Gene Expression Omnibus. According to the information on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/overview.html" target="_blank">GEO's website</a>:

*"A Series record links together a group of related Samples and provides a focal point and description of the whole study. Series records may also contain tables describing extracted data, summary conclusions, or analyses. Each Series record is assigned a unique and stable GEO accession number (GSExxx)."*

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/" target="_blank">Here</a> you can use GEO's search tool to find a dataset that aligns with your research interests.

Once you have found a series record you would like to work with, you can load it into this tool by inputting the GSE ID in the format GSExxx (e.g., "GSE68849").
