### Downloading data
* __What does "Trouble establishing connection to GEO. Please try again later" mean?__
    + Your GEO ID is likely in the right format, but it doesn't exist on GEO. Try searching for that dataset on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/) to see if it actually exists. If you're sure it does, try refreshing the app. Please make sure to use the identifier that starts with "GSE" (see the Series section on [this page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK159736/)).
* __What does "File not found. Please enter a valid ID" mean?__
    + Your GEO ID is probably not in the right format. Try searching for that dataset on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/) to see if it actually exists. Then copy and paste the identifier for that dataset into the text field. Please make sure to copy the identifier that starts with "GSE" (see the Series section on [this page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK159736/)). Please make sure it doesn't have any extra characters (spaces, dashes, etc).
* __Why isn't the reset button doing anything?__
    + "Reset" restores the data to its original format upon being downloaded. If there haven't been any changes to the data, nothing will happen.

### Reformatting columns
* __Why are my columns disappearing?__
    + Columns that are identical (have all the same values in the same positions) are automatically filtered out at every evaluation.
